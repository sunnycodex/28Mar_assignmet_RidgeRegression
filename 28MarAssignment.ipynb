    "What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Ridge Regression is an adaptation of the popular and widely used linear regression algorithm. It enhances regular linear regression by slightly changing its cost function, which results in less overfit models. Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares Regression lies in their treatment of multicollinearity, a situation where independent variables are highly correlated. In scenarios of multicollinearity, while OLS estimates are unbiased, their variances are large which results in predicted values being far away from actual values. Ridge Regression addresses this issue by introducing a degree of bias into the regression estimates, which results in significantly lower variance."

    "1. Linearity: The relationship between predictors and the response variable is linear.\n",
    "2. Constant Variance: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",

    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection, but it doesn't perform feature selection in the same way as methods like Lasso Regression. Ridge Regression primarily focuses on regularization rather than feature selection, and its primary goal is to prevent overfitting by encouraging smaller coefficients for all features rather than forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero."

    "Ridge Regression addresses multicollinearity by introducing a degree of bias into the regression estimates, which results in significantly lower variance. This is achieved by adding a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty term reduces the coefficients of the correlated variables, thus mitigating the impact of multicollinearity.\n",

    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, the coefficients represent the average effect on the response variable of a one unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other predictors fixed. However, these coefficients are subject to a penalty term controlled by the tuning parameter λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "As λ increases, the penalty becomes more influential and the Ridge Regression coefficient estimates approach zero. In general, the predictor variables that are least influential in the model will shrink towards zero the fastest. This means that larger coefficients correspond to more important features."
